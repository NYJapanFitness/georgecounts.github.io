  <h4>Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.</h4>
  <p>-- Janis Joplin</p>

  <h4>The chains that keep us from freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of the past fears and anxieties about the future, ambitions for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own importance.</h4>
  <p>--Anthony Demello</p>

  <h4>Freedom is being able to utilize <b><i>your</b></i> brain to construct <b><i>your</b></i> own thoughts, views and conclusions on things that may or may not matter. Freedom is the ability of unchoreographed choice carrying your own intentions.</h4>
    <p>-- George Mathis</p>
